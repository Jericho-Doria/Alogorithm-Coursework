1) Bubble Sort Solution

import time
start_time = time.time()
#imports the input file of the grades
#To input test cases import files in testcase folder, then change the variable name arr in
# arr=[] and arr.append to any name as you like as long the file is imported
numbers = open("arr.txt", "r")
arr = []
for _ in numbers:
    arr.append(int(_))

#bubble sort
def bubbleSort(arr):
#Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(len(arr)):
#Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, len(arr) -i- 1):
# traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
# Swap if the element found is lesser
# than the next element
            if arr[j]  < arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
bubbleSort(arr)

def Classes_Sort(grade1,grade2):
    grades = []

    for i in arr:
#Check for imported text file, arr, of first class and second class grade
# add to the list and scan the length of the graded list
        if  grade1 >= i >= grade2:
            grades.append(i)
    student_total = len(grades)
    return student_total
#Print Class orders of each specific class rankings
print('Number of students with 1st class:',Classes_Sort(100,70))
print('Number of students with 2:1 class:',Classes_Sort(69,60))
print('Number of students with 2:2 class:',Classes_Sort(59,50))
print('Number of students with 3rd class:',Classes_Sort(49,40))
print('Number of students who failed:',Classes_Sort(39,-100))


print(arr)

end_time = time.time()

print("\nRunning time: ", end_time-start_time)



2) Random Number Generator 

from random import randint

#Create Random integers with specific range for the grades input
a = [randint(0, 100 )for i in range(5)]
with open("arr.txt", "w") as fwrite:
    for listitem in a:
        fwrite.write('%s\n' % listitem)





3) Selection Sort Solution 

mport time
start_time = time.time()
#imports the input file of the grades
#To input test cases import files in testcase folder, then change the variable name arr in
# arr=[] and arr.append to any name as you like as long the file is imported
numbers = open("arr.txt", "r")
arr = []
for _ in numbers:
    arr.append(int(_))

#Selection sort
def selectionSort(arr):
#Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(len(arr)):
#Find the maximum element in the remaining
#unsorted array
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[min_idx] < arr[j]:
                min_idx = j
#Sap the found maximum element with
#with the first
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

selectionSort(arr)


def Classes_Sort(grade1,grade2):
    grades = []

    for i in arr:
#Check for imported text file, arr, of first class and second class grade
# add to the list and scan the length of the graded list
        if  grade1 >= i >= grade2:
            grades.append(i)
    student_total = len(grades)
    return student_total
#Print Class orders of each specific class rankings
print('Number of students with 1st class:',Classes_Sort(100,70))
print('Number of students with 2:1 class:',Classes_Sort(69,60))
print('Number of students with 2:2 class:',Classes_Sort(59,50))
print('Number of students with 3rd class:',Classes_Sort(49,40))
print('Number of students who failed:',Classes_Sort(39,-100))


print(arr)

end_time = time.time()

print("\nRunning time: ", end_time-start_time)
